    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is a measure of the computational time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of its input size. Efficient algorithms aim to minimize time complexity to handle larger datasets and provide faster results.</p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses during execution. It is often expressed using Big-O notation, such as O(n), to describe the relationship between memory usage and input size.</p>
